# Vewlix Button-7-Manager
The Button 7 Manager is a device that allows you to remap the functionality of buttons 4 and 7 on a Vewlix style control panel. This will work with any 7 or 8 button arcade stick layout, but it was specifically designed with the Vewlix layout in mind. 

With this project you can change the mapping of button 7 between 3 different modes.
 - Normal Mode: Both buttons 4 and 7 function as usual.
 - Button 4 Exclusive Mode: Button 7 is remapped as button 4 and button 4 is disabled. 
 - Button 4 Dual Mode: Button 7 and Button 4 are both mapped as button 4

# Installation Intstructions
